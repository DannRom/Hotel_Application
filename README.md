JavaFX Hotel Application

### Goal
Learn Java through project based learning, by creating a GUI interface for database processing. 

### The Application
This small standalone app will serve to assist receptionists at hotels by providing an interface to enter guest information
such a their room selection, how long they'll stay, how much it will cost.

### Improvements/Lessons to take for the next project.
1. Sanitize data entries.
2. Condense oversized methods which utilize Java's JDBC package.
3. Create dynamic search fields to search guest information (such as billing information, how long they'll stay, and any special requests)
and another for rooms status (whether it is ready, occupied, or needs cleaning and/or repairs).
